I test things here

## Flask
A few small apps I wrote in Flask to practice working with Javascript and glueing front/backend.

* *Sum app*: HTML form with 2 entries. Enter 2 integers and get their sum as a `alert` on your screen.

The way this works is:
    - `index.html`: this is the site itself with the form.
    - `script.js`: used a `fetch` method to POST data from the form, and receive a processed reply from backend
    - `app.py`: receives the POST from the frontend, adds the inputs and returns jsonified dictionary with answer for processing by JS.

## React
A few small apps I wrote in React for practice.

* *TicTacToe* this is from the official React tutorial. I created this code from scratch after going through the tutorial a few times.
